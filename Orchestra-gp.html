    <h3>How To contact We Five Music In Nigeria</h3>
    <p>The simplest way to contact we Five music record label is to reach out to its CEO in person of Samantha.

        And when doing so, you have to ensure you are really talented and also have a stroke of luck, but connections will really increase your chances the more.
        
        By connection, I mean you have to know someone who is close to, and can recommend you to her.
        
        I am saying this because frankly, 95 percent of artist signed to record labels in Nigeria are connection to the CEO in one way or another.
        
        Now, lets quickly look some of the ways you can contact Samantha, if you really want to sign a record deal with 5 start music record label.</p>
        <h3>Contact Samantha on his social accounts</h3>
            <p>Without a doubt, Samantha is one of the Nigerian businessmen who are so active on social media, especially Instagram and Twitter.

            And it is on record that heso much loves to engage or interact with his followers or fans.
            
            But before you approach Samantha, make sure you have the right content that are going to attract her.
            
            What am trying to say here is that you should have relevant content you have published on social media and tag E-Money to them.

            As a matter of fact, you have to keep it in mind that Samantha is not going to respond immediately, so therefore persistent and consistency coupled with patience is needed so much if you want to gain Joseph Chukwuebuka attention on social media platforms.
